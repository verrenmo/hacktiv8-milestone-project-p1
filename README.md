# 📊 **Hacktiv8 - Milestone 2 Project**
**by Verren Monica**  
**Phase 1 | Batch: RMT - 038**  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on developing and optimizing **classification models** (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) to **predict loan approvals**. The models are evaluated using **accuracy and ROC AUC** to ensure reliability. The best-performing model is fine-tuned and deployed to assist **banks and financial institutions** in streamlining their loan approval processes.  

## 🔍 **Background Problem**  
The **loan approval process** at banks involves analyzing multiple factors, making it **time-consuming and complex**. Mistakes in assessing creditworthiness can lead to **financial losses** due to defaults or missed opportunities.  

By implementing a **machine learning model**, banks can:  
✅ **Reduce risk** by identifying high-risk applicants accurately.  
✅ **Speed up loan approvals**, improving customer experience.  
✅ **Make objective, data-driven decisions**, reducing subjectivity in approvals.  

This project applies **various classification algorithms** and evaluates them using **accuracy and ROC AUC scores**. **Data balancing techniques** are applied if necessary to ensure fair model performance. The best model is **optimized and deployed** for real-world use by banks.  

## 🎯 **Objectives**  
🔹 Develop machine learning models using **Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.  
🔹 Evaluate models using **accuracy and ROC AUC** as key performance metrics.  
🔹 Apply **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize the best model.  
🔹 Deploy the best model to assist **banks in loan approval processes**.
